# University-AI-Project-Hex-Game-
In this project, I built an AI agent that plays the hex game with a user. 
It was my 6th-semester project at the University of Guilan. I considered some features for the agent based on the game 
then I gave weight to each feature, this weighted features made the agent make decisions almost correctly.
